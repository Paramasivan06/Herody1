                        <h1>Refund Policy</h1><br>
                        <h2>1. Overview</h2>At Herody, we are committed to providing our clients with high-quality
                        project services.
                        We understand that sometimes circumstances may arise that prevent the completion of the
                        requested work.
                        In such cases, we have established this refund policy to ensure transparency and fairness in
                        resolving issues related to incomplete work.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h2>2. Eligibility for Refund</h2>
                        <p>Refunds will be considered under the following circumstances:</p>
                        <p>a. The project provider is unable to initiate the work within the agreed-upon timeframe.</p>
                        <p>b. The project provider is unable to complete the work as specified in the project order.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h2>3. Initiation of Refund Request</h2>
                        <p>To initiate a refund request, the client must follow these steps:</p>
                        <p>a. Contact Herody Support: The client must contact Herody's customer support team within
                            [specified time frame] of the project order's completion date or within [specified time
                            frame] of the expected start date if the project hasn't begun.</p>
                        <p>b. Provide Details: The client should provide detailed information about the issue, including
                            the project order ID, the nature of the problem, and any relevant evidence such as
                            communications with the project provider.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h2>4. Evaluation and Processing</h2>
                        <p>Once a refund request is initiated, Herody will evaluate the claim based on the provided
                            information and applicable policies. The decision on whether to grant a refund will be made
                            at Herody's discretion.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h2>5. Refund Determination</h2>
                        <p>If the refund request is approved:</p>
                        <p>a. For uninitiated projects (not started yet): The client will receive a full refund of the
                            project's cost.</p>
                        <p>b. For incomplete projects (partially completed or not meeting the client's requirements):
                            The refund amount will be based on the extent of the work completed and the client's
                            satisfaction level.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h2>6. Refund Method</h2>
                        <p>Refunds will be processed using the same payment method the client used to make the initial
                            payment. The time it takes for the refund to be credited to the client's account may vary
                            depending on the payment provider.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h2>7. Dispute Resolution</h2>
                        <p>In the event of a dispute between the client and the project provider regarding a refund
                            request, Herody may facilitate communication and mediation to help reach a mutually
                            satisfactory resolution.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h2>8. Refund Exclusions</h2>
                        <p>This refund policy does not cover situations where the client cancels the project for reasons
                            unrelated to the project provider's performance.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h2>9. Policy Changes</h2>
                        <p>Herody reserves the right to make changes to this refund policy at any time without prior
                            notice. Clients are encouraged to review the policy periodically.</p>
